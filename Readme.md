# Speed Throne Website Frontend private work

Contributed to the development of the Speed Throne website for a visually stunning PC game that utilizes Unreal Engine 5â€™s advanced features, including Nanite for high-detail graphics, Lumen for dynamic lighting, and Chaos for realistic vehicle physics. 
As a frontend developer, I built and optimized the site using Next.js to provide an engaging and seamless user experience. 
The project also integrates with the Cardano blockchain to enhance the game's online ecosystem.
